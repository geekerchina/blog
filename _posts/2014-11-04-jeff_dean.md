#jeff dean

##1. build a smart system: perceive and understand the world
1. need to write general algorithms that learn from observations
2. advantages of google: pictures Text all over the world

##2 general machine learning approaches
1. supervised learning
2. unsupervise learning
3. reninforcement learning

##3 deep learning
1. loosely inspired by what(little)We learn from biol brain
2. higher abstrations

##4 what neural network can do
1. picture
2. audio
3. translate

##5 how to do big conpute-network
1. model parallel
2. data parallel (asynchronous Distributed stochastic gradient descent)

##6. applications
###6.1 <5days 800 machines to model speech recognition
used in jellybean
###6.2 2012 object recognition
###6.3 2014 object recognition 24 layers

##7 how DNN possibly deal with sparse data: Embeddings
1. skip-gram to predict the ie(aka) nearby words
2. analogies rome-italy~germany-berlin
3. can we embeded longer pieces of text?
4. Text classification (example. IMDB)
5. LSTM for end to end translation
6. generation image captions from piexl

##8 conclusion
1. effectiveness of dnn
2. An important tool to build a intelligent
